# Enterprise RAG Architectures

Designing retrieval-augmented generation systems for reliability, governance, and production-grade intelligence at scale.

---

## Article Focus

- Written for: Technology architecture teams, finance risk/compliance teams, healthcare knowledge-platform teams, and NHS digital transformation teams
- Primary value: trusted retrieval and decision support with measurable governance

---

## Why Enterprise RAG Is Different

A production-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stack is not just "LLM + vector DB". In enterprise settings, every answer must be:

- Grounded in trusted internal knowledge
- Enforced by role and policy controls
- Observable with quality and latency SLAs
- Auditable for compliance and model risk

---

## Reference Architecture

### 1. Data Ingestion and Knowledge Processing
- Structured (databases, warehouses)
- Semi-structured (PDFs, Office docs)
- Unstructured (emails, transcripts)
- CDC + scheduled sync pipelines
- PII and policy tagging at ingestion time

### 2. Retrieval and Memory Layer
- Embedding indexes (semantic search)
- Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + embeddings)
- Metadata filters (region, sensitivity, department)
- Knowledge graph for entity-level reasoning
- Policy-aware filtering

### 3. Orchestration Layer
- Intent classification and query rewriting
- Multi-stage retrieval and reranking
- Context budgeting by token and relevance

### 4. Generation Layer
- Task-specific prompts and response schemas
- Tool-augmented generation
- Citation-first answer formatting

### 5. Trust, Safety, and Evaluation Layer
- Guardrails and policy checks
- Hallucination and groundedness scoring
- Real-time monitoring with feedback loops

## Design Principles for Production RAG

- Treat retrieval as a first-class product
- Separate retrieval, reasoning, and generation concerns
- Enforce governance before and after generation
- Optimize for groundedness over fluency
- Build continuous feedback loops from real user traffic
- Prefer structured outputs over free-form responses

---

## Key Enterprise Metrics

### Retrieval Quality
- Recall at k and nDCG
- Citation coverage percentage
- Freshness lag from source to index

### Generation Quality
- Groundedness score
- Factual consistency
- Task completion rate

### Reliability and Cost
- p95 latency by route
- Cost per answered query
- Error and fallback rates

## Vector Database Options and Comparison

| Option | Best Fit | Strengths | Tradeoffs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pinecone | Managed enterprise deployments | Fast setup, reliable managed scaling, strong ecosystem adoption | Higher managed cost at large scale |
| Weaviate | Teams needing rich filtering + hybrid search | Strong schema/filter support and modular architecture | Requires careful tuning at high scale |
| Qdrant | High-performance, cost-aware production | Excellent vector performance and payload filtering | Fewer fully managed enterprise features out of the box |
| Milvus | Large-scale self-hosted workloads | Strong throughput and horizontal scaling | Operational complexity if self-managed |
| pgvector (PostgreSQL) | Teams standardizing on Postgres | Simpler stack, transactional + vector together | Can become expensive for very large retrieval workloads |
| OpenSearch / Azure AI Search (vector enabled) | Existing search platform users | Combines lexical + vector in familiar search stack | Feature depth and tuning vary by platform |

### Selection Heuristics
- Choose managed-first if your team is early and wants speed to production.
- Choose self-hosted/high-control if data residency or cost control is dominant.
- Validate with your own corpus: recall quality, filter performance, latency, and operational load.

## Embedding Model Strategy (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude Stacks)

Yes, it is useful to mention model families in the article. The most durable approach is to explain **when** to use each pattern rather than hardcoding benchmark claims.

### Practical Pattern
- OpenAI-first stack: strong default for general enterprise semantic retrieval and multilingual business corpora.
- Gemini-first stack: useful when your broader platform already uses Google-native workflows and tooling.
- Claude-centric generation stack: commonly paired with dedicated embedding providers for retrieval while using Claude for reasoning/generation.

### How to Decide
- Corpus characteristics: domain language, multilingual needs, document length patterns.
- Retrieval quality: recall at k, nDCG, and citation-grounded answer quality.
- Runtime economics: embedding cost per document, re-index cadence, query volume.
- Governance: data handling requirements, regional controls, auditability expectations.

### Recommended Operating Model
- Keep retrieval and generation loosely coupled.
- Standardize an internal evaluation harness.
- Run periodic A/B retrieval tests before changing embedding providers.

## Common Failure Modes and Mitigations

### Failure Mode: Retrieval Misses
- Cause: weak metadata, poor chunking
- Mitigation: schema-aware chunking + reranking + query rewrite

### Failure Mode: High Confidence Hallucination
- Cause: low-quality context or no citation enforcement
- Mitigation: citation-required templates + abstain policy

### Failure Mode: Policy Leakage
- Cause: ACL checks happen too late
- Mitigation: enforce policy filters before retrieval returns candidates

---

## Finance Example (Regulatory Intelligence)

### Typical Challenges
- Regulatory updates across jurisdictions
- Auditability and traceability requirements
- Sensitive financial data segmentation

### Architecture Pattern
- Hybrid retrieval from policy docs + controls database
- Graph linking between regulation, process, and control owners
- Structured output with source paragraph references

### Example Query
Explain variance in liquidity coverage ratio and cite relevant internal policy clauses.

---

## Healthcare Example (Clinical Knowledge Assistant)

### Typical Challenges
- Rapidly changing medical evidence
- Conflicting patient history and guideline updates
- Safety-critical response requirements

### Architecture Pattern
- Temporal retrieval with date-aware ranking
- Clinical guardrails for contraindications
- Human-in-the-loop escalation for uncertain recommendations

### Example Query
Suggest treatment adjustments for a diabetic patient with declining renal function using the latest approved protocol.

## Implementation Roadmap

1. Start with one high-value workflow and clear acceptance metrics
2. Build ingestion contracts and metadata taxonomy
3. Implement hybrid retrieval + reranking before model tuning
4. Add guardrails, policy checks, and citation enforcement
5. Launch shadow testing, then canary rollout
6. Close the loop with automated evaluation and user feedback

## Final Thought

Enterprise RAG becomes a durable competitive capability when it is engineered as a full system: retrieval quality, orchestration intelligence, governance controls, and measurable business outcomes.
